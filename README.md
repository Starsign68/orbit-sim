# Orbit simulator

Still a work in progress!

This is a JavaScript tool for simulating gravity with a rocket in a simplified, two-dimensional version of our solar system, with the intenion of teaching fundamental aspects of orbital mechanics. Simulates the affect of all bodies – rather than using a patched conics approximation – in order to demonstrate more interesting phenomena such as precession.

It's cheaper and more physically accurate than Kerbal Space Program!
