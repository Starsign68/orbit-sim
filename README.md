# Orbit simulator

Still a work in progress!

This is a JavaScript tool that simulates gravity in a simplified, two-dimensional version of our solar system, with the intenion of teaching fundamental aspects of orbital mechanics. It simulates the effect of all bodies – rather than using a [patched conic approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patched_conic_approximation) – in order to demonstrate more interesting phenomena such as precession.

No external dependencies and fully compatible with Internet Explorer, so there should be no problems running it.

See the [current version of the simulation](https://lusign68.github.io/orbit-sim/orbit.html) in action.
